CALLOSUM is an interactive audio-visual installation accompanied by a workbook designed to help you understand your unique musical taste.

Most people are exposed to a wide variety of music. 
Over time, we develop preferences for certain types of songs. Using the Spotify API, we set out to discover a way to visualize the features which characterize your favorite music.
